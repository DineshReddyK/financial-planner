## Tools
### Investment Calculator
The Investment Calculator provides a glimpse of potential returns you can achieve after retirement by making investments in various categories. It helps you compare different investment options and choose the one that aligns best with your financial goals.

### Mortgage Calculator
The Mortgage Calculator is a simple loan repayment calculator that includes monthly, yearly, and one-time prepayment calculations. It gives you a clear picture of how much you can save by making prepayments on your loan, helping you manage your debt more efficiently.
